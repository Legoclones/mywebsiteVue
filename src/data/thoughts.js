        question: 'What do you consider to be your greatest professional achievement?',
        answer: 'My greatest professional achievement (up to this point) is getting in the top 6% in Redpwn\'s Capture the Flag competition in July of 2021. Ian Cook and myself worked for months up to the competition teaching other cybersecurity students the skills we\'ve gained from previous CTFs. We created a GitHub repository with all our lessons plans for each week\'s meetings (you can find it on my GitHub). Redpwn\'s CTF was a 3-day competition, which we spent practically every waking hour grinding on; my focus was web exploitation. We were very happily surprised to place 7th out of 135 teams, so the top 6% in the College Division. I believe that this is only the beginning for BYU\'s CTF group.'

        question: 'What are your greatest strengths?',
        answer: 'I would say my greatest strengths are probably an attention to detail, being a natural leader, and a quick learner. I think that one of the greatest keys to success (and something many employers are looking for) is initiative - you are expected to get things done without having to be commanded in every little task. Those three strengths help me to take initiative in my work.'

        question: 'What\'s your biggest weakness?',
        answer: 'I think my biggest weakness is facing rejection - it sucks. I remember when I served as a missionary in Houston, Texas. I had a responsibility to share my beliefs with everyone who was willing to listen and learn, and there really weren\'t many of them! It was hard getting out each day, and I felt down and depressed a lot. That being said, I don\'t give up. I talked to the other missionaries about my struggles so we could support each other, and I tried different strategies to help me feel more positive and motivated to leave our apartment each morning. I can honestly say that I worked through the pain of rejection and was able to share my beliefs with many other people.'

        question: 'Describe your dream job.',
        answer: 'My dream job is to work in a cybersecurity-related position where I can help protect other people from various malicious actors. I think the most important part of my dream job is the environment - I idealize working with others who know and respect me; they know where my boundaries are, but can push me to be better. I would love to collaborate with coworkers who also believe in what they\'re doing and want to serve others.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What do you like to do outside of work and school?',
        answer: 'I spend a lot of my time outside of work and school learning new technical skills, such as web exploitation methods, password cracking, and studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification. I also play soccer once or twice each week. When I\'m not doing those, I\'m spending time hanging out with family and friends!'
